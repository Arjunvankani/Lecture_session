# Hospital Data Analysis Assignment

## Overview
This assignment is designed to help students practice **data analysis** skills on a hospital transactions dataset. The tasks involve **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and insight generation**. Students will gain hands-on experience working with real-world healthcare data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains hospital transaction records with the following columns:

| Column Name        | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Record_ID         | Unique identifier for each transaction |
| Date              | Date of the transaction |
